 - In your existing score, navigate to Edit -> Instruments

 - Add as many voices as there are instruments in the MusicXML file

For example, in this MusicXML, there are two instruments

So add 2 voices to your score :

 - Copy and paste the notes from the MusicXML file to the voices you created in your existing score
